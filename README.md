I am new here, my curiosity of 3d printing and my love of building as well as my electronic history have come to bring me
Here.  I am at a loss since my background is in computerrs before the internet and after DOS.
I have been working construction and fabrication forever.
I have learned how to weld after buying a welder. I learned to run my own business after I buried my last friend and mentor.
Time has moved fast and I see gray hair now when a year or so back had color..
I am not broken as those who came before me, willing to share there knowledge.
I am here to learn, share, and teach, but that is not easy to do without help of those who know.
Young or old we all, if willing, can learn new ideas.
...That is my intro...

I am late to the 3d scene, do to COVID I now own my resin printer and two basic Ender 3s.
One of which I am attempting to make a dual or more extrusion.
My first attempt was to use an Ender 5 plus control board, fail.
Second, I attempted a MKS Robin Nano v3.1, fail. I need
Help. I am about to pick up a BTT Pro v1.2 32-bit but I am not sure
If it will be any better.

Whomever wants to share with me I look forward to it.
